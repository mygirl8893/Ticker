# Ticker
Ticker is a simple Bitcoin price ticker for iOS built in a few hours after seeing the [Mt.Gox streaming API](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/MtGox/API/Streaming).

*The values shown should not be depended on, check Mt.Gox itself if you're going to buy Bitcoins or something. Ticker is only for fun & information purposes.*

## Building
You need to have [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) installed on your computer to build the project. `cd` in the project directory and run `pod install`. Open `Ticker.xcworkspace` after CocoaPods is done with its stuff, and build/hack away.
